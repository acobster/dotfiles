# My dotfiles.

## SETUP

### Automatic install

First, [install Nix](https://nixos.org/download).

```sh
nix-shell -p curl --run 'sh <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acobster/dotfiles/main/bin/init)'
```

You can pass the following options (append to the `sh` command):

- `--skip-ssh` if you already created an SSH key
- `--skip-github` if you already authorized GitHub
- `--skip-profile` to skip sourcing `~/.profile` from `/etc/profile.d/nix.sh` (required for desktop apps)

### Manual Setup

[Install Nix](https://nixos.org/download).

Start a new shell with the stuff we'll need:

```sh
nix-shell -p curl git home-manager
```

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:acobster/dotfiles.git # over SSH - requires a key
git clone https://github.com/acobster/dotfiles.git # over HTTPS
```

Note that cloning over HTTPS may require you to change your origin later if you want to push changes.

Finally, we can run the thing:

```sh
bin/build home -b backup --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'
```

**NOTE: for desktop apps on Ubuntu, you need to explicitly source `~/.profile` from a script inside `/etc/profile.d/`:**

```sh
# /etc/profile.d/nix.sh

if [ -f /home/tamayo/.profile ] ; then
  . /home/tamayo/.profile
fi
```

### Setting up syncthing

Standard shared folders should already be declared in your Nix config. To start syncing files from `nastyboi`, it's best to go to `nastyboi:8384` and manually add your local device from there. Then share the folders accordingly, and accept them on the other end. Syncthing should be smart enough to figure out which files need syncing (on a fresh install, all of them).
